# MVC drill

This project is the result of my quest to understanding what an MVC structure implies and how to implement it with PHP.

This is exclusively a development project.

I was typing all the instructions on how to run the project but realized there was not much point as the project works with a local database and all the data was entered pre-emptively with no user-interaction.

All you can do then is enjoy the code !
